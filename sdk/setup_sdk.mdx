Before making any method calls, initialize the SDK with your Client ID and configure the API base URL at runtime.

## Constructor

Create an instance with your clientId. You can optionally pass apiBaseUrl, authToken, env, and other options.

### ESM/CommonJS Usage

```javascript
import AcountPay from '@acountpay/sdk';

const sdk = new AcountPay({
  clientId: process.env.REACT_APP_ACOUNTPAY_CLIENT_ID,
  env: process.env.REACT_APP_ACOUNTPAY_ENV || 'production',
});
```
