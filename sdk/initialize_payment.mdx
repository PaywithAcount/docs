title: 'Initialize Payment'
description: ''
---

The `initiatePayment` method is used to start a payment transaction using the SDK. It creates a payment request, retrieves a secure payment token, and initializes the payment process via the SDK. If the transaction is successful, it triggers a callback function (`onSuccess`).

This method is **only available on an instance of the`Account` class** and must be called after initializing the `Account` class with a valid `clientId`.

***

## **Prerequisites**

Before using `initiatePayment`, ensure that:

âœ” You have initialized the `Account` class with a valid `clientId`.

âœ” You have a valid **amount** and **reference number** for the payment.

âœ” You provide a callback function (`onSuccess`) to handle a successful transaction.

***

## **Method Signature**

```typescript
async initiatePayment({
  amount,
  referenceNumber,
  onSuccess,
}: {
  amount: number;
  referenceNumber: string;
  onSuccess: (status: { success: true }) => void;
}): Promise<void>;
```

## **Parameters**

| Parameter         | Type                                  | Required | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `amount`          | `number`                              | âœ… Yes    | The amount to be paid.                                       |
| `referenceNumber` | `string`                              | âœ… Yes    | A unique reference number for the payment transaction.       |
| `onSuccess`       | `(status: { success: true }) => void` | âœ… Yes    | A callback function executed when the payment is successful. |

* **`amount`**: The transaction amount (should be greater than `0`).
* **`referenceNumber`**: A unique identifier to track the payment.
* **`onSuccess`**: A function that receives `{ success: true }` when the payment completes successfully.



## **Example Usage**

### **Step 1: Initialize the Account Class**

Before calling `initiatePayment`, you must first create an instance of the `Account` class:

```typescript
import Account from "acount-sdk";

// Initialize Account with your Client ID
const sdk = new Account({
  clientId: "your-client-id-here",
});
```

### **Step 2: Initiate a Payment**

Once the `account` instance is created, you can call `initiatePayment`:

```typescript
sdk.initiatePayment({
  amount: 150.00,
  referenceNumber: "TXN-123456",
  onSuccess: (status) => {
    if (status.success) {
      console.log("Payment completed successfully!");
    }
  },
}).catch(error => {
  console.error("Payment initiation failed:", error);
});
```

***

## **Handling Errors**

If an error occurs during payment initiation, it is:

* **Logged to the console** for debugging.
* **Displayed as an alert message** to notify the user.

### **Common Errors and Fixes**

| Error Message                     | Possible Cause                                      |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `"Client ID is required"`         | The `Account` class was not initialized properly.   |
| `"Invalid amount"`                | Ensure `amount` is a valid number greater than `0`. |
| `"Reference number missing"`      | The `referenceNumber` parameter is required.        |
| `"Payment initialization failed"` | Network issues or invalid API credentials.          |

***

## **Return Value**

This method **does not return** any value (`Promise<void>`). Instead, it either:

* Executes `onSuccess({ success: true })` upon successful payment completion.
* Throws an error and alerts the user if an issue occurs.

***

## **Key Takeaways**

âœ” **Requires an`Account` instance** to be initialized before use.

âœ” **Handles secure payment processing** by generating a token and starting the SDK.

âœ” **Triggers a success callback** when the payment is completed.

âœ” **Provides built-in error handling** for common issues.

By following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate payment processing into your application using the SDK. ðŸš€
