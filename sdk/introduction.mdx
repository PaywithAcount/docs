description: 'AcountPay SDK enables seamless account-to-account payments directly from your web applications. With AcountPay, your customers can make payments directly from their bank accounts without using credit cards.'
---

## Key Features

- **Direct Bank Account Payments**: Connect to customers' bank accounts securely via open banking
- **MitID Authentication**: Secure authentication via the customerâ€™s bank (MitID)
- **Instant Transfers**: Real-time payment processing between bank accounts
- **Multiple Account Support**: Customers select which account to pay from during the bank flow
- **Mobile-Friendly Flow**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile experiences

## How It Works

1. **Your app creates a payment** by calling the AcountPay SDK, which in turn calls your backend.
2. **Your backend** creates the payment and returns a one-time link token URL.
3. **The SDK redirects the browser** to a hosted SCA flow (Token.io) where the customer:
   - Selects their bank and account
   - Authenticates with MitID
   - Confirms the payment
4. **After completion**, the customer is redirected back to your app (per your backend/flow configuration), and both customer and merchant receive confirmation.

> Note
> - The SDK performs a browser redirect to a hosted pages flow; it does not render an embedded payment UI or React components.
> - Your backend must implement the documented endpoints the SDK calls to create payments and fetch a link token.

## Next Steps

- **Install**: npm i @acountpay/sdk  
- **Setup**: Configure your build with `process.env.API_BASE_URL` for your backend origin.  
- **Initialize a Payment**: Call [initiatePayment({ amount, referenceNumber })](cci:1://file:///Users/gustavjacobsen/Documents/GitHub/tailwind-react-test/token-sdk/src/index.ts:13:2-34:3) to begin the flow.
