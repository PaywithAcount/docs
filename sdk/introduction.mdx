description: 'AcountPay SDK enables seamless account-to-account payments via a user-first flow. Customers are redirected to the AcountPay user portal (user.acountpay.com) to securely link their IBAN before payment.'
---

## Key Features

- **User-First Flow**: Redirects customers to the AcountPay user portal to securely link IBAN
- **Bank-Grade Auth (e.g., MitID)**: Authentication and consent handled by the customer’s bank
- **Instant Transfers**: Real-time account-to-account payments
- **Runtime Configuration**: No baked-in API URLs; configure at runtime
- **TypeScript Support**: Includes type definitions and ESM/CJS/UMD builds

## How It Works

1. **Your app calls the SDK** to initiate a user payment flow.
2. **SDK calls your backend**: `POST {BASE}/sdk/users/{clientId}/payment-request` with `{ amount, requestId, callbackURL }`.
3. **Backend responds with a redirect URL** containing the user portal flow (e.g., `https://user.acountpay.com/...`).
4. **SDK redirects the browser** to the portal, where the customer:
   - Links an IBAN to their user
   - Authenticates and consents
5. **After completion**, the customer is redirected back to your app via your configured `callbackURL`.

> Note
> - The SDK performs a full-page redirect to the user portal; it does not render an embedded UI.
> - Ensure your app’s origin and `callbackURL` are whitelisted on your backend.
> - Amounts are in major units (e.g., `1` = 1 DKK).

## Next Steps

- **Install**: `npm i @acountpay/sdk`  
- **Setup**: Configure the SDK at runtime (e.g., set `window.__ACOUNTPAY_API_URL__` or pass `apiBaseUrl` to the constructor).  
- **Initialize a User Payment**: Call [initiateUserPaymentByEmail({ amount, requestId, callbackURL })](cci:1://file:///Users/gustavjacobsen/Desktop/token-sdk-main/src/index.ts:54:2-94:3) to begin the flow.
