## Error Handling

Common errors:

- **400**: Validation issues (e.g., missing fields, invalid dates).
- **401**: Unauthorized (invalid/missing token).
- **404**: Resource not found (e.g., consent/account).
- **500**: Internal errors â€“ contact support.

Error responses typically include:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 500,
  "message": "Internal server error"
}
```

## Best Practices

- Always check consent status before fetching data.
- Handle token expiration by regenerating as needed.
- Use pagination for large transaction sets.
- Securely store user IDs and merchant IDs.
- Monitor `x-request-id` for debugging.

> For integration with Token.io, refer to their [Accounts API documentation](https://reference.token.io/tag/Accounts).
