The Account merchant dashboard helps you streamline payment management and seamlessly integrate our payment solution into your app or e-commerce site. Use it to configure your integration, track transactions, and manage your account. Get access to it here:

The following is a brief introduction on the features of the dashboard and how to get started.

<Accordion title="Onboarding" icon="fa-info-circle">
    **Create Your Account**: Begin by signing up on our platform using our auth portal.

    **Complete the Onboarding Form**: Once registered, fill in the short onboarding form with your company details, address, and payment callback URL. This information is essential to activate your dashboard and ensure smooth payment processing.
</Accordion>

The dashboard is divided into *four* key sections: **Transactions**, **Profile**, **Developer** and **Billing**

<Accordion title="Transactions" icon="fa-info-circle">
    **Comprehensive Monitoring**: View a complete list of all transactions processed through our payment app on your website.

    **Flexible Exports**: Easily export your transaction data as a standard CSV file. For bulk payment management (e.g., processing refunds), a bank specific CSV export format is also available.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Profile" icon="fa-info-circle">
    **Account Details**: Access your profile to review the company information you provided during onboarding. (For any changes, please reach out to our support team.)

    **Bank Account Linking**: Securely connect your primary bank account via our integrated AIS feature to ensure smooth payment transfers **(This is required in order for your integration to work)**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Developer" icon="fa-info-circle">
    **Integration Essentials**: Retrieve your unique `client ID` from the Developer section. This identifier is required when configuring our SDK on your e-commerce platform, ensuring that the payment method functions seamlessly.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Billing" icon="fa-info-circle">
    **Payment Setup**: Add your credit card through our secure Stripe integration for metered billing, which is calculated bi-weekly based on your transaction volume.
