1. **Overview of AcountPay**

   > AcountPay enables secure, bank-to-bank payments without needing cards or manual account entry. It’s ideal for businesses that want to offer fast, low-cost payments via open banking.
2. **Key Concepts**
   - **Paylink** — What it is, how it’s generated, and how it works (temporary URL, QR-compatible, etc.)
   - **Checkout Overlay** — How the checkout experience is embedded into the page.
   - **API Keys** — Explain sandbox vs live, and what they’re used for.
   - **Payment Request** — Parameters required, and how it triggers the paylink generation.
   - **WebSocket Connection** — Used for real-time payment updates.
   - **Environments** — Sandbox vs Production, what’s different in each.
3. **How it works**
   1. User lands on merchant’s webpage.
   2. Merchant site calls API with amount \+ key → gets a paylink.
   3. Overlay opens with QR code or redirect link.
   4. User completes payment in external bank app or on same device.
   5. Websocket keeps merchant site in sync.
   6. Confirmation or timeout sent back via WebSocket / Webhook.
4. **Environments and API keys**

   | **Environment** | **API Key Type** | **Use Case**                |
   | :-------------- | :--------------- | :-------------------------- |
   | Sandbox         | Dev/Test Key     | For testing payment flows   |
   | Production      | Live Key         | For accepting real payments |
