# POS Terminal System

The AcountPay POS terminal makes accepting payments simple with a 3-step process that works on any device.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Payment Details
- Enter the payment amount
- Ask the customer which bank they use
- Select their bank from the dropdown list
- Add optional description

**Important:** Always ask the customer which bank they use before generating the QR code. This ensures they're redirected to the correct banking app.

### Step 2: Tips (Optional)
If you have tips enabled:
- Customer can add 10%, 15%, 20%, or 25%
- Or enter a custom tip amount
- Or skip the tip entirely

### Step 3: QR Code Generation
- System generates a secure QR code
- Show the code to your customer
- They scan with their phone camera or banking app
- Payment processes automatically

## Payment Status

You'll see real-time updates:
- **Pending**: QR code created, waiting for customer
- **Scanned**: Customer has scanned the code
- **Processing**: Payment being processed
- **Completed**: Payment successful
- **Failed**: Payment was declined

## Transaction Management

### View Your Transactions
Access your complete payment history with:
- Date and time filtering
- Transaction amounts and status
- Customer bank information
- Success/failure details

### Export to CSV
**Two Ways to Export:**

1. **From POS Terminal**: Navigate to Transactions → Export to CSV
2. **From Dashboard**: Visit [merchant.acountpay.com](https://merchant.acountpay.com) → Transactions → Export

**Use exports for:**
- Accounting software import
- Tax preparation
- Business analysis
- Record keeping

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Wrong Bank Selected:**
- If customer realizes wrong bank was chosen, generate a new QR code
- Cancel the current transaction and start over
- Double-check bank selection before generating QR code

**QR Code Won't Generate:**
- Check internet connection
- Verify merchant account status
- Ensure correct bank is selected
- Try refreshing the session

**Payment Stuck in Processing:**
- Wait for timeout (usually 5 minutes)
- Check with customer's bank
- Generate new QR code for retry
- Contact support if persistent

**Customer Can't Scan QR Code:**
- Ensure QR code is clearly displayed
- Check lighting conditions
- Try refreshing/regenerating code
- Verify customer's banking app supports QR payments

### Error Codes

| Code | Description | Resolution |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `POS001` | Invalid amount format | Check amount contains only numbers and decimal |
| `POS002` | Bank not available | Select different bank or try later |
| `POS003` | Payment timeout | Generate new QR code |
| `POS004` | Network error | Check internet connection |


<Note>
  Always confirm the customer's bank selection before generating the QR code to ensure a smooth payment experience. The bank choice determines which login portal the customer will see.
