# POS Terminal System

The AcountPay POS terminal is designed for quick, efficient transactions with a three-step payment process optimized for touch devices and mobile interfaces.

## How the POS Terminal Works

The POS terminal guides merchants through a streamlined payment process:

### Step 1: Payment Details

**Enter Transaction Information:**
- **Payment Amount**: Enter the total amount to be charged
- **Payment Type**: Choose between Guest or User Account payment
- **Bank Selection**: **Ask the customer which bank they use** and select it from the dropdown list
- **Description**: Add optional transaction description for records

**Bank Selection Process:**
1. **Ask Customer**: "Which bank do you use for online banking?"
2. **Select from List**: Choose the customer's bank from the dropdown menu
3. **Confirm Selection**: Verify the correct bank is selected before proceeding

**Validation:**
- System validates amount format and minimum requirements
- Ensures all required fields are completed before proceeding
- Displays any validation errors clearly

**Supported Banks:**
- Major European banks through Token.io integration
- Real-time bank availability checking
- Automatic bank logo and branding display

**Important Note:**
The bank selection step is crucial as it ensures the customer will be redirected to their correct banking portal for payment authorization. Always confirm with the customer which bank they prefer to use for the transaction.

### Step 2: Tip Management
