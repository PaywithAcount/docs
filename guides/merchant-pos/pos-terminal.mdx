# POS Terminal System

The AcountPay POS terminal makes accepting payments simple with a 3-step process that works on any device.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Payment Details
- Enter the payment amount
- Ask the customer which bank they use
- Select their bank from the dropdown list
- Add optional description

**Important:** Always ask the customer which bank they use before generating the QR code. This ensures they're redirected to the correct banking app.

### Step 2: Tips (Optional)
If you have tips enabled:
- Customer can add 10%, 15%, 20%, or 25%
- Or enter a custom tip amount
- Or skip the tip entirely

### Step 3: QR Code Generation
- System generates a secure QR code
- Show the code to your customer
- They scan with their phone camera or banking app
- Payment processes automatically

## Payment Status

You'll see real-time updates:
- **Pending**: QR code created, waiting for customer
- **Scanned**: Customer has scanned the code
- **Processing**: Payment being processed
- **Completed**: Payment successful
- **Failed**: Payment was declined

## Transaction Management

### View Your Transactions
Access your complete payment history with:
- Date and time filtering
- Transaction amounts and status
- Customer bank information
- Success/failure details

### Export to CSV
**Two Ways to Export:**

1. **From POS Terminal**: Navigate to Transactions → Export to CSV

### Error Codes
