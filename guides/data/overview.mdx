# Data API Overview

This API enables merchants to securely access and manage user banking data.

## What You Can Do

- **Create and manage user consents** for accessing bank data
- **Retrieve linked bank accounts**
- **Fetch account balances and transaction history**
- **Authenticate securely** using JWT-based authentication

> **Note:** All endpoints require authentication via a Bearer token, except for token generation.

## Key Concepts

- **Consent:**\
  A user's authorization to access their bank data. Consents have statuses (e.g., `pending`, `authorized`) and expiration dates.
- **Account ID:**\
  A Token.io-generated identifier for each linked bank account.
- **Permissions:**\
  Scopes such as `ReadAccountsDetail`, `ReadBalances`, and `ReadTransactionsDetail` (mapped to your API permissions like `ais:accounts:read`).
- **On-Behalf-Of:**\
  Your API handles Token.io calls on behalf of the user or merchant.

## Authentication & Permissions

- All endpoints (except token generation) require a Bearer token.
- Permissions are scoped to actions like reading accounts, balances, and transactions.

## Usage Notes

- For production, update the base URL accordingly.
- Always include an `x-request-id` header for tracking requests.
