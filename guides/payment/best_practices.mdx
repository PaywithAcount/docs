### Best Practices for Using our Payment SDK

 1. **Secure API Credentials** – Keep your API keys and credentials private; never expose them in client-side code or public repositories.
 2. **Always Initialize Properly** – Ensure the SDK is correctly initialized with valid credentials before making any payment requests.
 3. **Handle Errors Gracefully** – Implement proper error handling and retries for failed transactions, timeouts, or network issues.
 4. **Use Webhooks for Real-Time Updates** – Set up webhooks to track payment status, handle asynchronous updates, and ensure accurate transaction processing.
 5. **Validate User Inputs** – Check and sanitize customer data before processing payments to prevent errors and security risks.
 6. **Test in Sandbox Mode** – Use a test environment to simulate different payment scenarios before going live.
 7. **Monitor Transaction Logs** – Regularly review logs to detect anomalies, troubleshoot failures, and improve system reliability.
 8. **Ensure Compliance** – Follow regulatory and security guidelines such as PCI-DSS for secure payment processing.
 9. **Optimize for Performance** – Minimize API calls, cache necessary data, and use efficient error-handling techniques to enhance performance.
10. **Provide Clear Payment Status Messages** – Display informative messages to users about payment status to improve transparency and trust.
11. **Support Multiple Payment Methods** – Ensure flexibility by integrating various payment options for a better customer experience.
12. **Implement Robust Security Measures** – Use encryption, tokenization, and fraud detection mechanisms to secure transactions.
13. **Ensure Smooth Refund Handling** – Provide a seamless refund and dispute resolution process to maintain customer satisfaction.
14. **Stay Updated with SDK Versions** – Always use the latest SDK version to benefit from security patches, bug fixes, and new features.
15. **Optimize User Experience** – Design a seamless and intuitive checkout flow to reduce friction and improve conversion rates.
