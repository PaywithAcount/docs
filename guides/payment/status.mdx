Understanding the lifecycle and flow of payments in the Acount payment system

Acount processes payments using the following three statuses:

| Status       | Description                                                                                                                                                      | Final/Intermediate |
| :----------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------- |
| **PENDING**  | The payment has been initiated and is awaiting confirmation. This means that the user has completed the necessary steps, and the transaction is being processed. | **Intermediate**   |
| **REJECTED** | The payment has failed or has been declined. This can happen due to insufficient funds, authorization failure, or other rejection reasons from the bank.         | **Final**          |
| **PAID**     | The payment has been successfully completed and settled. This indicates that the funds have been transferred to the recipient.                                   | **Final**          |

These statuses provide a simplified view of the payment flow while mapping to the more detailed statuses from our underlying infrastructure.

**PENDING**: aligns with statuses like `PROCESSING`, `PENDING`, and `INITIATED`.

**REJECTED**: aligns with statuses like `FAILURE_DECLINED`, `FAILURE_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS`, and `FAILURE_CANCELED`.

**PAID**: aligns with` SUCCESS` and `SETTLEMENT_COMPLETED`.

Any additional statuses from our underlying infrastrucutre are handled internally and mapped to one of the above three statuses to keep our system user-friendly.
